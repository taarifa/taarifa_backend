Security Model
==============

Draft security model, briefly discussed by Mark Iliffe
<markiliffe@gmail.com>, Aidan Skinner <aidan@skinner.me.uk> and Adam
Kurkiewicz <popantrop@gmail.com> in chat but definitely open to
revision

Goals
---------

Taarifa allows crowd sourced reports of points on a map, such as a
waterpoint. Retaining ease of access while also allowing some trusted
users to revise data based on further information

Scope
-----

Basic authentication
Authorisation of only certain actions

Allow any user to create a new report
Only allow authorised users to edit or remove report
Only allow authorised users to create other authorised users

Future ideas
------------

* Track who makes "bad" submissions, possibly ban them

* Have certain users who are known to make "good" submissions have
  faster workflow to the map
